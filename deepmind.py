Context:
1. <premise 1>
2. <premise 2>

Question: <question text>
Selection:
- <premise number>. <premise text>
- ...

Then you will be given the real Context and Question.
Your task:
    1. Choose the minimal subset of the numbered premises, at most 3-4 premises, that is strictly necessary to perform the very next inference step toward answering the final question.
    2. Only select from the provided premises; do not invent new facts.
    3. Respond with one line per selected premise, in the form:

2. Multiple Choice: If the question offers options labeled A, B, C, or D, reply exactly with one of A, B, C or D.
